      <h1> Example</h1>
      <p>so if you were to run the following "poetry code": </p>
      <br>
      <p class="text-light bg-dark">The ball was /choice(red > blue > green)</p>
      <br>
      <p>It would create the following generative poem: </p>
      <br>

      <p id="poem">
      waiting for poem to be generated.
      </p>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="showExample()">Regenerate poem</button>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>This type of language for creating randomised peotry, would simplify the poem emmensly for the average person to write. For instance the javascript I wrote to make the above example is pretty nasty if you don't know how to code:</p>
      <br>
      <p class="text-light bg-dark">function showExample() {<br>
        console.log("running");<br>
        let poem_txt = "the ball was "<br>
        poem_txt += ["red", "green", "blue"][Math.floor(Math.random()*3)];<br>
        document.getElementById("poem").innerHTML = poem_txt;<br>
      }<br>
    </p>
    </div>
  </body>
